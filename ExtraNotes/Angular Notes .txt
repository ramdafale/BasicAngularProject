Selector: It is used as an html tag in template. It extends html power ups it.
template : inline(template USED for short template  ) and external(templateUrl: enter relative path of template. USED for longer  template  )  


Interpolation: One way binding. from component class properties to an element propery. It directly communicate with template and class. It binds those together. What you declare in class will be direcly display in template using expression {{ }} .. expression can be concatination, simple calculation or a method call.

Adding new component named as product-list.component which shows product details.

Structural  Directive: it is use for manipulation of data. 
eg. *ngIf  (asteric denotes thyem as sturctural directive)
 *ngFor  ->Repeats the portion of the DOM tree once for each item in an iterable LIST.
<tr *ngFor =' let product1 of products123'>  (let is template input varible. we can reference that varible on any sibling or child element)


Use of "of" and "in"

of-> gives direct properties from array. Iterates the array.

Step1: Use directive as a element in the template for any other component.  We use the directive component selector as a direcvtive name. 
 We then declare the component so it is availabe to any template associate with this angular module.   
 We add the component to declaration array passed into the NGMODULE decorator of the angular model. 

Adding new interaction to product list component. such as show images hide images.(making it interacvtive)
1.Property Binding []-> Allows us to set a property of an element to the value of a template expression.

<img [src]='product.imageUrl'>       [] Binding  target and element property, '' Binding Source and template Expression
Add image height width property to image in product list component class.
and bind that to html tag.

2.Event Binding () ->   (show images button )
Responsive  binding: Component listen to user actions (click on show images) using event binding. 
<button (click)='toggleImage()'>         click()= target event name     toggleImage()= name of property from component class called as template statement
    1. declare property 2. define method in component class , write logic 3. write event in html file and call method from component class
	4. and also use directive for toggle logic if condition. USe conditional operator in interpolation to toggle between show and hide text.
	

3. Two way binding : Handling input with two way binding : ngModel directive is use
ngModel in square bracket is used to bind the property from component class to the input element. and parathensis () to indicate event binding to send a notification of user entered data back to the class property. ad then we assign this directive
<input [(ngModel)]='listFilter'>      


export class ListComponent {
listFilter:  string :'cart';
}
